# SOLID_Principle_Assignment
# we selected 3 SOLID Principle Out of 5 are:-
S - Single-responsiblity Principle
L - Liskov Substitution Principle
D - Dependency Inversion Principle
# Also Write a blog about the chosen principles and explain your work on the Knoldus blogs:
Single-Responsibility Principle:A class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job.
Liskov Substitution Principle:-This means that every subclass or derived class should be substitutable for their base or parent class.
Dependency Inversion Principle:-
Dependency inversion principle states:
Entities must depend on abstractions, not on concretions. It states that the high-level module must not depend on the low-level module, but they should depend on abstractions.
